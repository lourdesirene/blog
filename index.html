        <h1>Innaugural Post</h1>
        <p>Just so. I'm not sure that I've much to say, consideiring the cirmcumstances. After the first week of developing development I remain on square one. I am confident that my days here are limited. A great place to  be. I look forward to more interesting posts with greater insight than this. For you and for me. </p>

        <h1>Innaugural Post Numero Dos</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, the second post leaves with much to be desired, as it is being written immediately following the inaugural post. In between posts, however (all three hours) I've been reading much about styling and bootstrap. I will embark on an experiment and report back on the results.</p>
